# Mobile Timer

This prototype is to limit the student's distraction by setting a timer for using the cellphone. The prototype is a physical rotational object, where a student can place their phone at, while studying. Then, the student can set a timer by rotating the object. If the phone is picked up before the timer goes off, the reading light will turn to a red color.
